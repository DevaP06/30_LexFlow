## Unified Digital Platform for Legal Consultation and Law Firm ERP

### Problem Statement

The legal industry in India largely relies on manual and fragmented systems for managing client consultations, case preparation, hearing schedules, document handling, and billing. Most law firms use physical diaries, paper files, emails, and informal communication tools such as WhatsApp for daily operations.

In real practice, clients usually approach a law firm rather than individual lawyers. The firm then assigns an available and suitable lawyer based on workload and expertise. This allocation process is mostly handled manually, which often leads to inefficiencies, delays, missed hearings, misplaced documents, and poor coordination among legal staff.

Due to the absence of a centralized digital system, maintaining complete communication history, tracking case progress, and managing billing records becomes difficult. Important context from meetings and client interactions is often lost, especially when lawyers are changed or when interns handle initial communication.

Document collection is also inefficient, as clients frequently forget to submit required documents. Payment tracking is inconsistent, making it difficult for both clients and firm administrators to maintain financial transparency.

This project proposes a Unified Digital Platform that onboards law firms and digitizes their internal workflows. Clients interact with law firms through the platform, while firms manage lawyer allocation, case handling, communication, documentation, and billing in a secure and centralized environment.
